The program will prompt the user for a base and a power (1 mark each x 2 = 2 marks total) either of which can be any non-negative integer

The program can correctly calculate an exponent when the power is zero (the result is just one). (1 mark)

The program can correctly calculate (using a loop) an exponent when the power is greater than zero. (2 marks)
